# Data Engineering, Lakehouses, and the Future of AI

Welcome to my digital garden. This is where I share my deep dives, tutorials, and thoughts on the evolving data landscape. 

As the Head of Developer Relations at Dremio and author of [**Apache Iceberg: The Definitive Guide**](https://drmevn.fyi/tableformatblog), [**Apache Polaris: The Definitive Guide**](https://drmevn.fyi/tableformatblog-62P6t), and [**Architecting an Apache Iceberg Lakehouse**](https://hubs.la/Q03GfY4f0), my mission is to make complex data architectures accessible to everyone.

## What You'll Find Here

*   **Apache Iceberg & Polaris**: Comprehensive guides on open table formats and catalogs.
*   **Data Lakehouse Architecture**: Strategies for building cost-effective, high-performance data platforms.
*   **AI & RAG**: Exploring the intersection of data engineering and Large Language Models.
